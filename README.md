# controls.xml-with-extra-buttons

The controls.xml file combines arcade button descriptions from -
- The well known but now quite out of date controls.xml from here: http://controls.arcadecontrols.com/
- An extra ~1k games from here: https://github.com/Texacate/Visual-RetroPie-Control-Maps/blob/master/primary_map.csv

Can be used in CPWizard to generate button images, by replacing the default controls.xml file in the Data dir, you may need to go into options > Mame paths and re-select a mame.exe to force it to regenerate the larger xml files used by CPWizard to generate buttons.
